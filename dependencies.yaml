# Contains a list of all files that could be tested and their dependencies.
# Adding a file here will cause it to be tested upon changes to it or some file it depends on by the CI-pipeline (a modular and scalable approach to the CI).
# Example:
# |- name: example     | name of the file
# |  extension: .py    | extension is used in case the file needs to be converted to another filetype for testing (notebooks)
# |  path: simulation/ | tells us where the file is located
# |  dependencies: []  | contains all files which uses this file, they will also be tested upon changing the file in question
